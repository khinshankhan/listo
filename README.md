# Warning

None of this code should be used as a dependency. This project should be used as is or with a fork because code will
likely be ripped out into separate and sensible packages as the project grows. Also, things will likely get renamed... a
lot.

This project is also a learning experience since there are several concepts and technologies I want to explore that
aren't my expertise... yet :smirk:

This whole thing is a WIP :shipit:
